Sky Informatics mines satellite data to create analytics and forecasts 
of high commercial value. 

<p> 

Satellites offer much more than awesome pictures. 
They measure cloudiness and wind speed.
They monitor hurricanes, floods and droughts. 
They quantify rainfall and snowpacks. 
They detect changes in soil moisture and ground water. 
They sense the types and productivity of commodity crops.  
And there are decades of such data. 

<p> 

At Sky Informatics, based on our expertise in data science and remote sensing, 
we integrate a wide array of satellite data and 
economic activity data, develop analytical models, and create 
insights and forecasts of high commerical impact.
